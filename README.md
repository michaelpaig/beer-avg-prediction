# Beer Rating Average Prediciton

#### Description
The goal was to see if I could predict the average rating of a beer on beeradvocate.com
using linear regression models without having taste, look, and smell of the beer as my features.
I was able to get a R2 score of .619 with a simple linear regression model.
